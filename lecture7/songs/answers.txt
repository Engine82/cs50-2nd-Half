1. This person's 'audio aura' is of songs that are rather danceable, of above average energy, and moderate valence. I hypothesize this may
correspond to a 'Purple' audio aura because the high dancaeability and above average energy would serve well to energize a person.

2. The previous calculation fails to account for variation in emotional charactaristics of songs of which are key factors in determining 'audio aura.'
The calculation provided assesses danceability, but one can dance slowly to a low energy song (think slow romantic songs).  Additionally, angry/agressive
songs can appear similarly to upbeat happy songs that are higher in energy in the provided formula; an angry agressive song can be similar in energy and
tempo to a happy song for example.  A better sense of 'Audio Aura' should look at averages of all categories, including key (to differentiate between happy
upbeat vs low and dark), and tempo.  Additionally, a specific comparison between tempo, valence and energy would help determine a song's overall emotional
orientation, which is a key factor in audio aura.
